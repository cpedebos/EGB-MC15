This repository contains the materials for the Molecular Dynamics Simulations: Theory and Applications mini-course.

**All notebooks are temporarily off**

## Day 1 – Introduction to Molecular Dynamics
Historical background of the technique, fundamental concepts, and key applications in biochemistry and structural biology. Discussion of the critical steps involved in a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation: system preparation, parametrization, minimization, equilibration, production run, and analysis.
