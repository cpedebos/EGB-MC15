# Molecular Dynamics Simulations: Theory and Applications

This repository contains the materials for the Molecular Dynamics Simulations: Theory and Applications mini-course.

## Day 1 – Introduction to Molecular Dynamics
Historical background of the technique, fundamental concepts, and key applications in biochemistry and structural biology. Discussion of the critical steps involved in a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation: system preparation, parametrization, minimization, equilibration, production run, and analysis.

**Slides:** [Slides](https://github.com/cpedebos/EGB-MC15/raw/main/EGB_MC15_Aula_1_Introduction_to_MD.pdf)  - `Introduction to Molecular Dynamics`

### Practical session: 
Execution of molecular dynamics simulations on two model systems, followed by analysis of structural and dynamic properties.

**Notebook:** [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/cpedebos/EGB-MC15/blob/main/CHARMM_GUI_EGB2025.ipynb)  - `Classical Molecular Dynamics simulations examples`

## Day 2 – Protein–Ligand Systems
Exploration of MD applications in studying protein–ligand interactions. Methods for evaluating stability and binding affinity, molecular docking, and post-simulation analyses.

### Practical session: 
Performing molecular docking followed by MD simulation of a previously modeled protein–ligand complex.

## Day 3 – Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics and Membrane Proteins
Introduction to coarse-grained (CG) models, including their advantages and limitations. Structural and dynamic features of membrane proteins and their biological significance.

### Practical session: 
Execution of CG simulations and membrane protein simulations, along with analysis of the resulting dynamics.

## Day 4 – Alternatives to Classical Molecular Dynamics for Conformational Sampling
Discussion of the limitations of classical MD and presentation of alternative methods for generating structural ensembles, such as AlphaFold subsampling and BioEmu-based approaches. Potential applications and limitations of these strategies.

### Practical session: 
Generation of conformational ensembles for different proteins using non-MD-based sampling approaches.

## Day 5 – Enhanced Sampling Methods
Analysis of the challenges in conformational sampling using classical MD. Introduction to advanced methods such as Steered Molecular Dynamics (SMD), Metadynamics, and others. Discussion of practical applications and implications for result interpretation.

## Practical session: 
Application of Steered Molecular Dynamics to induce and analyze conformational changes in a previously studied protein–ligand system.
